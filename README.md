## 👋 About Me

I'm a full-stack developer with a focus on creating responsive, user-centric web applications. My journey started with a curiosity about how the web works, and it's evolved into a passion for building products that people actually want to use.

Currently, I'm diving deep into modern web development, with hands-on experience in:
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Backend Concepts**: APIs, data persistence, server architecture
- **Progressive Web Apps (PWA)**: Offline-first design, Service Workers, IndexedDB
- **User Experience**: Responsive design, accessibility, intuitive interfaces
