# Linen PWA - Personal Memory App

Linen is a privacy-focused Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to help you capture, organize, and recall your personal memories and thoughts. It acts as a personal assistant that listens, remembers, and helps you notice patterns in your life.

## Features

- **AI Assistant (powered by Google Gemini API):** Chat with your personal assistant to gain insights from your memories, understand patterns, and support decision-making.
- **Offline-First:** Works entirely offline thanks to Service Workers and local IndexedDB storage, ensuring your data remains private and always accessible.
- **Secure Local Data:** All your memories and conversations are stored securely on your device, with nothing leaving your local environment.
- **Intuitive UI:** A clean and minimal interface designed for seamless interaction.
- **Cross-Platform:** Installable on mobile and desktop for a native-like experience.
